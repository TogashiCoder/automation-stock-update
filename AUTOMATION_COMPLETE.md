## üèóÔ∏è What You Get

### Automated Infrastructure

- **CodeBuild Project**: Runs your stock update script in AWS
- **EventBridge Scheduler**: Twice daily execution at 7 AM and 5 PM France time (Monday-Saturday)
- **Secrets Manager**: Secure storage for FTP credentials and email settings
- **S3 Bucket**: Artifact storage and backups
- **CloudWatch**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- **SNS Alerts**: Notifications for build failures

### Management Capabilities

- **Safe Testing**: Dry-run mode prevents accidental changes
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Easy schedule modifications via script
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Build status and log streaming
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Complete deployment health checks
- **Secure Secrets**: Encrypted credential storage

### Operational Benefits

- **Zero Maintenance**: Runs automatically without intervention
- **High Reliability**: AWS-managed infrastructure with automatic retries
- **Scalable**: Handles growing data volumes and supplier counts
- **Auditable**: Complete logs and execution history
- **Cost Effective**: Pay only for actual execution time

## üìä Monitoring and Management

### Daily Operations

```bash
# Check recent builds
python deploy/test-build.py --recent

# View schedule status
python deploy/schedule-management.py --status

# See next execution times
python deploy/schedule-management.py --status --next 5
```

### Troubleshooting

```bash
# Full health check
python deploy/validate-deployment.py

# Test specific build
python deploy/test-build.py --start --dry-run

# Monitor build in real-time
python deploy/test-build.py --monitor <build-id>

# Check recent EventBridge invocations
python deploy/schedule-management.py --invocations
```

### Configuration Updates

```bash
# Update FTP credentials
python deploy/update-secrets.py --interactive

# Change schedule
python deploy/schedule-management.py --schedule "cron(0 8 * * MON-FRI *)"

# Temporarily disable automation
python deploy/schedule-management.py --disable
```

## üîê Security Features

### Credential Management

- All sensitive data stored in AWS Secrets Manager
- Automatic encryption at rest and in transit
- No credentials in code or configuration files
- IAM role-based access (no long-term keys)

### Network Security

- CodeBuild runs in AWS-managed secure environment
- Optional VPC configuration for network isolation
- HTTPS/TLS for all external communications

### Access Control

- Minimal IAM permissions (principle of least privilege)
- CloudTrail logging for all API activities
- Resource-level access controls

## üìà Production Readiness

### Reliability Features

- Automatic retry logic for transient failures
- Individual supplier/platform error isolation
- Comprehensive error logging and reporting
- S3 backup of critical data before changes

### Performance Optimization

- Parallel processing of multiple suppliers
- Efficient file handling and processing
- Configurable timeout and resource limits
- Optimized build caching

### Monitoring and Alerting

- CloudWatch metrics for all operations
- Email notifications for failures
- Detailed execution reports
- Real-time log streaming

## üîÑ Operational Workflows

### Normal Operation (Automated)

1. EventBridge triggers CodeBuild at scheduled time
2. CodeBuild downloads latest code from GitHub
3. Script downloads files from supplier FTP servers
4. Stock data is processed and aggregated
5. Updated files are uploaded to platform FTP servers
6. S3 backups are created for safety
7. Email report is sent with execution summary

### Manual Testing

1. Use dry-run mode for safe testing
2. Monitor logs in real-time
3. Validate outputs before enabling uploads
4. Test individual suppliers/platforms as needed

### Emergency Procedures

1. Disable automation immediately if needed
2. Access CloudWatch logs for troubleshooting
3. Restore from S3 backups if required
4. Re-run with specific supplier/platform scope

## üéØ Best Practices

### Regular Maintenance

- Review logs weekly for warnings or errors
- Update Python dependencies monthly
- Test credential rotation quarterly
- Validate backup integrity regularly

### Performance Monitoring

- Track execution duration trends
- Monitor FTP connection success rates
- Review file processing statistics
- Optimize schedule based on data patterns

### Security Hygiene

- Rotate FTP passwords regularly
- Review IAM permissions quarterly
- Enable CloudTrail if not already active
- Monitor for unusual access patterns

## üìû Support and Troubleshooting

### Self-Service Diagnostics

1. Run `python deploy/validate-deployment.py --test-build`
2. Check recent builds with `python deploy/test-build.py --recent`
3. Review CloudWatch logs in AWS console
4. Test individual components in isolation

### Common Issues and Solutions

- **Build failures**: Check secrets configuration and FTP connectivity
- **Email not sent**: Verify Gmail app password and SMTP settings
- **Missing files**: Review supplier FTP server contents and mappings
- **Permission errors**: Validate IAM roles and policies

### Getting Help

- Review comprehensive documentation in `docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
- Check AWS service health dashboard
- Validate network connectivity to FTP servers
- Test with reduced scope (single supplier/platform)
